![alt text](https://asfabricstorage.blob.core.windows.net/lab1images/10.png)

* Choose a name for your node type as &quot;Node 0&quot;
* The minimum size of VMs for the primary node type is driven by the durability tier you choose for the cluster. The default for the durability tier is bronze.
* Select the VM size as &quot;Standards\_D1\_v2&quot;
* Choose the number of VMs for the node type as 1
* Select Three node clusters
* Configure custom endpoints with 80,8770
