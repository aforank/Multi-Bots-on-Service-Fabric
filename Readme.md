# Orchestrating Multiple Intelligent Bots as Microservices on Azure Service Fabric

## Abstract

Azure service fabric is a great platform to build reliable and scalable microservices. In this session, we will uncover how we developed multiple specific child bots, orchestrated by a master bot on top of Service fabric to achieve hyper scalability. You will see what designs and principles we applied to overcome various challenges. Next, weâ€™ll dive into how we leveraged Actor programming model to store the bot state reliably within the cluster itself. Then, we'll talk about how we managed to test and troubleshoot using Application Insights and Finally, we publish all the bots through DevOps automation.
